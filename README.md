# Line-Follower-Robot
A small robot that follows a black line
## Introduction
It is a small robot that has 2 motors thar are connected to an atmega 32 microcontroller .It follows a specific black path using sensors to detect the line and give feed-back 
 to the microcontroller that determines the direction the robot should take
 ###Components
 .Atmega32 borad
 .2 Dc Motors
 .2 IR Sensors
 .L293D Motor Driver
 .Jumpers wires
 ###Software
 I used Microship Studio IDE for this project but I developped the MCAL Layer myself
 Idid not use the Library of AVR
